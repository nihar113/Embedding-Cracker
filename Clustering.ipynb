R. Rahman, whose blend of Asian culture with rock and Western classical styles has revolutionized the Indian film industry. And now Rahman is about to make his mark in Hollywood. A. R. Rahman, interviewed by CNN's Screening Room . Virtually unknown in Europe and the U.S., Rahman has sold 200 million albums worldwide -- more than the Beatles -- and is worshipped throughout much of Asia, where he's known as the Mozart of Madras. Now he has added a Hollywood film score to his vast repertoire of movie music. Rahman explained to CNN what he thinks makes great movie music. \"A great soundtrack is like 'Laura\"s theme', the 'Love Story' theme, 'Chariots of Fire' and all those sorts of things, where it stood by itself,\" he said. But recently, he's noticed a changing mood. \"Now it is becoming too abstract and more ambient and more... I don't know, soundscape-ish, more than melody. People are afraid of melody: 'Oh, that melody is distracting my scene,' it is becoming like that.\" And that brings fresh challenges for the makers of film music. \"Now the challenges of the composer are much more,\" he told CNN. \"One needs to know of recording, production, it is not enough to compose a great theme and [know] how it can intertwine with the movie. And with Indian film it is an even greater challenge, because we need to be like Michael Jackson, John Williams, Hans Zimmer and an Indian folk composer all put together. So they expect finesse and they expect versatility.\" Rahman's compositions are versatile enough to be used by both Bollywood and Hollywood, a case in point being his music for the Hindi film \"Dil Se,\" which was used almost a decade later by Spike Lee for \"Inside Man.\" But for Rahman, the process to create film music is being challenged by increasingly crammed movie schedules. \"There used to be a time where the director and the composer would work together,\" he explained. \"They would develop themes and the director would shoot a scene, but now the world's so fast that people are finishing the movie even before going to a composer.\" As well as writing songs and scores, Rahman has featured in many Bollywood films singing the songs which are mimed by the acting superstars. He recently completed a sell-out tour of the U.S. performing highlights from his songbook to devoted fans. He explained to CNN how playback singing is a normal part of Indian film music. \"Well, until I worked in 'Bombay Dreams' six or seven years back, I never realized that it is not cool to have playback singing. Until then, it was the story of Indian films where somebody else lip synchs and somebody else sings.\" And Rahman has been converted to the Western model, where those singing on-screen usually provide the vocals themselves. \"In my future projects I would rather have a star who sings,\" he said. Director Shekhar Kapur recruited Rahman and fellow composer Craig Armstrong to provide the score for Cate Blanchett's sequel to \"Elizabeth,\" \"The Golden Age,\" which premieres at Toronto Film Festival in September this year. Kapur described the thrill of working with two such different -- and complementary -- composers. He told CNN, \"Here are two totally different cultures. Craig Armstrong is strings and heart, the skies, choir, angels and devils, and A. r. is modern, restless music.\" \"Just to get them together was very interesting for me. To sit there and see both of them jamming together, that was fascinating. They wouldn't talk, they would jam, and out of the jamming came the music. It was great.\" Rahman is still getting used to his new-found status as darling of both East and West -- and it leads to a somewhat chaotic lifestyle, as he explained. \"It is terrifying sometimes. I suddenly wake up in Scotland doing music for 'Golden Age,' and suddenly wake up doing an Indian superstar film, but I think after all these years I am probably getting a balance.\" E-mail to a friend .\n(CNN) -- Hate to stand in long lines on Black Friday?

Ready for launch: video game programmer Richard Garriott shown in training for his space flight in October. Aside from the obvious financial limitations which restrict space tourism to the rich and the ridiculously rich, there are also significant training programs and testing to be completed before proceeding to lift-off. To gain a better insight into this training, well-known video game programmer and designer Richard Garriott, who is preparing for his own space adventure in October, is detailing in a blog what he and others have to go through in order to make it into orbit as a space traveler. Garriott has been in training since the beginning of the year and told CNN the first major thing to surprise him was the intensity of preparations. \"When I first came here in January, I thought nine months to get trained for this is going to be plenty of time. Of course, very quickly, I realized that I had signed up for a very complex task, something much more difficult that I had anticipated. I immediately knew that nine months was going to be a lot of work to get everything prepared for the flight. \"And now that I am so close to the flight, I am still feeling the pressure, I definitively have been working very long days and most nights,\" Garriott said. The training regime has three major strands: physical training, which includes preparation to acclimatize to the space environment; practical training for day-to-day living in space; and like any flight, be it 10 minutes or 10 days, training in safety procedures for emergency situations. Trainees generally spend nine months or more on and off-site to complete the requirements, which include everything from flight simulations to learning how to use the toilet. Eric Anderson, president and CEO of Space Adventures, the company sending Garriott into space, told CNN the training program is extensive, but does not exclude people from making the flight. \"Their total training program is a few months, but we tend to spread it out so they can fit it around their normal lives. They are not training to the same degree as the professionals.\" As long as space hopefuls are in reasonable health, they can usually go ahead with their adventure, he said. \"There's some fitness involved. There are certainly [medical] things that are not allowable in space, but they are generally more serious conditions.\" He said the major fitness issue with space travel was preparing for the change in \"Gs.\" \"The body is designed to live on one 'G,' so when you expose it to higher 'Gs' it has an effect. With the training and given the [short] length of the visits there's a minimal effect on the body.\" In his blog on the training process, Garriott said one part of the training was indisputably the worst. \"Hardest of all was the 'Spinning Chair of Ultimate Sickness.' I can't imagine that I will ever again voluntarily sit in a device designed to make you sick, or ride it as long as I can. Ugh, this is definitely my least favorite part of training!\" Despite such disturbing preparations, Anderson said much of the training, which takes place at Space Adventures' base in Star City, Russia, is centered upon general living in space. \"There's a few requirements about what you need to know to live in the space station ... how to eat, how to drink, and how to use the restroom, for example,\" he said. \"There's also a lot of simulation you go through ... there's preparation to acclimatize you to the space environment.\" Garriott said many of the procedures for living in space, or for emergencies, are very complex. \"There are a lot of technical details behind all the different systems we need to understand ... fire detection and alarms, plus procedures and equipment for dealing with fire emergencies; protective breathing apparatus in case of chamber decompression or malfunction; the toilet (everybody's favorite piece of space trivia!), including powering up the can for suction and waste removal; and lastly, onboard water sources.\" He admits the learning requirements had him preparing for exams by \"cramming like any good college kid.\" And the most fascinating part of the training? In Garriott's opinion, it was running in a hypobaric chamber, where the altitude was set at 10,000 meters (about 2,000 meters higher than Mount Everest). \"I felt no physical or mental problems, but I did notice an odd physiological issue that is quite hard to describe. Basically, it was possible to make a tennis ball-sized pocket in my mouth, but one which had no air in it as it was just a vacuum! \"By that I mean try to imagine creating a cavity inside your mouth without any air bubbles and by letting in no air through your lips or throat -- it's basically impossible at sea level because the air pressure outside your mouth pushes the air pocket closed,\" he said. \"However, at 10,000 meters the air is so much thinner that you can pull off this oral stunt without a hitch! Weird.\" It truly is.\n\n[0.9665118691237833, 0.7595008813120413, 0.7163007338621993]\n(CNN) -- The credit crisis has transformed the global financial landscape, bankrupting established names and prompting unprecedented interventions by governments and central banks to save others from collapse as they buckle under the weight of \"toxic debts.\"  This timeline charts the key moments in that process. 2007 Feb. 7: HSBC announces losses linked to U.S. subprime mortgages.

The company, citing \"rising commodity prices and challenging lease economics,\" said it planned to close a number of underperforming coffee shop locations as part of its reorganization. \"I'm excited about the opportunity to save hundreds of jobs, give back to Seattle and become a larger part of the economic growth and fabric of the community,\" the actor said in a statement released Wednesday. Tully's Coffee confirmed Thursday that Dempsey is part of an investment group, but had no comment on the effort. \"We will know by 5 (p,m.) today how many bids have been submitted,\" marketing director Diane Geurts said. \"The (bankruptcy) auction takes place on January 3 and the final hearing is on January 11.\" The hunky Dempsey plays Derek Shepherd, nicknamed \"Dr. McDreamy,\" on the TV series. The medical drama's setting is Seattle. \"I've always loved this city, and with the purchase of Tully's Coffee, I plan to spend a lot of time in Seattle and at the stores connecting with the community and growing the Tully's brand,\" Dempsey said. \"It looks like Seattle may be my home away from home in the very near future.\" According to Dempsey, Tully's Coffee operates 47 locations in Washington and California with other franchises across the country. The bankruptcy filing did not affect Tully's Coffee online sales and wholesale business, which were purchased in 2009 by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters.

The pair wed before close friends and family in Austin on Saturday evening. They started dating in 2006, and the Brazilian model is the mother of his two children. Last year, McConaughey, 42, said while there were no immediate plans to get married, that did not make them any less committed. \"Maybe one day ... maybe something down the line at the right time,\" he told CNN's Piers Morgan. \"To do that, you have to really feel it. You have to really want to move forward to those things. Right now we are wonderfully happy, healthy. I get no pressure.\" McConaughey and Alves, 30, got engaged in December. McConaughey has appeared in several movies, including \"The Wedding Planner\" and \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.\"\n\n[0.9655711099949233, 0.9608629658468245, 0.9439563028414478]\n(CNN) -- Concern over the spread of the Ebola virus has caused the cancellation of an African Cup of Nations football match. The Seychelles was due to host Sierra Leone in a qualifying game on Saturday, but the tiny island nation's ministries of health and immigration prevented the visiting players from entering the country. At least 525 cases of Ebola have been reported in Sierra Leone since March, 224 of which have been fatal. Seychelles, which was trailing 2-0 after losing the away leg of the second-round qualifier in Sierra Leone on July 19, has forfeited both the tie and its hopes of reaching next year's tournament finals. Sierra Leone players were on Friday reportedly prevented from boarding a plane at Kenya's Nairobi Airport that would have taken them to the Seychelles. Seychelles Football Federation president Elvis Chetty told CNN that there was little choice but to follow government advice and forfeit the match, which was to be held in the capital Victoria. \"After being advised by the ministry of health to postpone the match for an indefinite period, the ministry of immigration informed us it would not allow the team from Sierra Leone to enter the Seychelles,\" Chetty said. \"Subsequently, the SFF felt it was prudent to forfeit the scheduled match as opposed to asking for a postponement. \"We respect the decisions taken by the authorities to safeguard the health interests of our country. \"Our thoughts are with the Sierra Leone people in their hour of need.\" There have been more than 1,300 confirmed or suspected Ebola cases in West Africa since March, when cases of the virus were first reported in Guinea. Other countries to be affected include Liberia and Nigeria. Sierra Leone president Ernest Bai Koroma has declared a public health emergency in his country in an attempt to stem the spread of the virus. One of the country's athletes at the Commonwealth Games in Scotland was taken to hospital last week to be tested for Ebola after feeling unwell. However, cyclist Moses Sesay was cleared and was able to compete in Thursday's men's individual time trial. Ebola is a viral hemorrhagic fever, affecting multiple organs and accompanied by bleeding. There is no known cure or specific treatments. The World Health Organization has said that drastic action is needed to contain what has fast become the worst outbreak on record.\n(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia has had its first death from swine flu, its Ministry of Health said Monday, bracing for more. The patient -- a 30-year-old man who lived in the country's Eastern Province -- was admitted to a hospital in the city of Dammam on Wednesday with a high fever, cough and shortness of breath. He died Saturday. Saudi Arabia has diagnosed more than 230 cases of the H1N1 virus this year. In the past few weeks, a debate about the virus has erupted in the Middle East. Of particular concern is how to keep it from spreading among the millions of visitors expected in Saudi Arabia during this year's Hajj -- a pilgrimage required of Muslims at least once in their lives. On Wednesday, Arab health ministers held an emergency summit in Cairo, Egypt, to discuss the issue. Guidelines were issued, banning various groups from participating in this year's Hajj -- children under 12, adults over 65 and people with chronic diseases. Saudi Arabia recommended that pregnant women stay home as well. At the close of the meeting, Saudi Health Minister Dr. Abdullah Al-Rabeeah told CNN that, in all, Saudi Arabia had issued 15 recommendations to help ensure the safety and health of pilgrims participating in the Hajj. \"The most important of those is, first of all, that they should take the seasonal flu vaccine two weeks prior to Hajj,\" Al-Rabeeah said. Even with the guidelines in place, World Health Organization spokesman Dr. Ebrahim el Khordany acknowledged that it won't be easy keeping potential pilgrims away. El Khordany told CNN, \"It was discussed in detail how it's going to be worked out between the country and Saudi Arabia to find out the best way to do it and, of course, to make sure that people don't try to use their connections to get their visas or to get to go to Saudi, because people are really very keen to go to the pilgrimage.\" The Saudi government has also said it will set up quarantine centers at airports as another preventative measure.\nMADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A restaurateur has gone to great lengths to tackle the spread of the H1N1 virus in his eatery, including taking staff's temperatures before they start work and preventing them from touching plates directly. Kitchen staff at Silk and Soya restaurant in Spain wear face masks and gloves while preparing food. Silk and Soya, a Thai-themed restaurant in Madrid, Spain, implemented the measures to prevent the spread of the H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu, in the upscale locale. \"We implemented these measures so that our employees would serve only food, not a virus,\" restaurant owner Cipri Quintas told CNN.   As well as employees having their temperatures taken before starting their shifts, windows are opened to aerate the restaurant before meals. Each table is set at least one meter -- 3.2 feet -- from any other table.   Any member of the kitchen staff involved in food preparation must wear a mask and gloves, and waiters are required to hold napkins when carrying plates to avoid touching them directly with their hands. Upon entering the elevators leading to the top-floor restaurant, customers find an automatic disinfectant gel dispenser.  At each table, diners find a packet of gel next to their silverware. The restaurant's restroom doors are propped open, the lights turn on automatically and the faucets are hands-free -- measures intended to keep customers from having to touch surfaces after they've washed their hands.   Similar initiatives are under way around the world. Last spring, during the peak of the scare in Mexico City, restaurants were closed for 12 days. When the restaurants reopened, the government ordered owners to put extra space between the tables and not to allow more than half of seats to be filled at any given time; cooks and waiters were mandated to wear surgical masks.   The World Health Organization's Web site states that hand-washing is one of the best ways to prevent infection and provides instructions with drawings that can be printed and posted in public places, such as restaurants. Silk and Soya's Quintas started his anti-H1N1 measures in August and has already proved popular with some customers. Simona Savin, who was having lunch, told CNN, \"These are measures you don't see everywhere. Here you have everything. They are great because there's a need for hygiene.\"   Another diner, swimming coach Fernando Barea, said, \"We came to the restaurant because we heard good things about it and I wanted to see these measures against the H1N1 flu. These measures should be used by other restaurants.\"   Quintas predicted they soon will be. \"People from other businesses like hotels and theaters have called us asking, 'What have you done? Can we come see your setup?' There's been a big response,\" said Quintas.   He insisted that his goal is not solely to garner publicity, but to protect his customers and staff -- a responsibility, he said, that the business community at large should undertake.   One expert on the disease applauded the efforts and recommended they be broadened.  \"They should implement them every winter against all respiratory diseases,\" said Dr. Tom Jefferson, a medical epidemiologist with the Cochrane Collaboration. The international organization reviews health care interventions and \"promotes the search for evidence in the form of clinical trials and other studies of interventions,\" according to its Web site.   As of September 13, the WHO had tallied more than 296,000 cases worldwide, 3,486 of them fatal.\n\n[0.9595329059985429, 0.9475312792083215, 0.940227576284418]\nAthens, Greece (CNN) -- Greek police have arrested the captain of a U.S. ship whose passengers and crew had hoped to help lead a Gaza-bound flotilla aimed at challenging Israel's maritime blockade of the Palestinian territory. John Klusmire, an American citizen and captain of The Audacity of Hope, was asked to report to a police station Saturday morning, said Jane Hirschmann, an American who is one of the flotilla organizers. A spokesperson with the Greek Coast Guard, who was not named per custom, confirmed Klusmire's arrest. The reason given was that he had left the mainland without permission and put passengers in danger. He will appear before Greek prosecutors on Tuesday. Hirschmann added that, in addition to disobeying a police order, Klusmire is being charged with disturbing sea traffic. \"This is intimidation,\" she said. \"They're making an example of our captain to stop other boats in the flotilla from trying to sail.\" His vessel -- which carried 36 American passengers, four crew members and several journalists, including CNN reporter Phil Black -- was intercepted Friday by a Greek Coast Guard patrol vessel roughly 10 minutes after it had departed Perama. The Greek authorities were in a standoff with the crew for about three hours, during which activists sang, chanted and waved signs in support of their mission. The ordeal took a turn, however, when an inflatable boat carrying an armed Greek military commando team told the activists to follow them back to port or face being boarded. Eventually, the ship returned to Greece, where it is now tied up at a Greek naval facility. Four other crew members have been ordered by Greek authorities to stay aboard the ship, Hirschmann said. Many other activist passengers have remained on the vessel as well, in a show of solidarity. The Audacity of Hope is one of 10 ships that organizers hope to unite to form a flotilla heading toward the Middle East. The trip is partially meant to commemorate a May 2010 incident in which Israeli troops boarded Mavi Marmara, a Turkish ship filled with humanitarian aid and 700 activists from various countries. Nine people died in subsequent clashes with Israeli Navy commandos. The Greek government said Friday that it won't allow any of the nine other boats in the flotilla to sail to Gaza because their mission is too dangerous. Flotilla members accuse the Greek government of buckling to pressure from Israel's government. For their part, the Israelis have said they are mounting a diplomatic offensive to try to stop the flotilla from setting sail at all. On Tuesday, the Israeli government said flotilla participants had threatened to kill Israeli military personnel should their boats be boarded. They alleged that the participants were stockpiling sacks of sulfuric acid on boats to be used in the event of any attacks on Israeli commandos. Flotilla organizer Medea Benjamin dismissed the allegations as ludicrous, saying: \"They see this nonviolent, rag-tag group of ships as such a threat they're using their entire propaganda apparatus, and their diplomatic and economic clout to try to stop 300 peace activists. It's pathetic.\" The Middle East Quartet -- composed of officials from the United States, United Nations, European Union and Russia -- on Saturday issued a joint statement asking \"all governments concerned to use their influence to discourage additional flotillas, which risk the safety of their participants and carry the potential for escalation.\" The Quartet added in its statement that it \"strongly urges all those wishing to deliver goods to the people of Gaza to do so through established channels, so that their cargo can be inspected and transferred via established land crossings.\" Doing so, the group contends, is the best way to both help Palestinians and address Israel's \"legitimate security concerns.\" Journalist Elinda Labropoulou contributed to this report.\nBogota, Colombia (CNN) -- Colombian rebels and the government are in \"exploratory\" talks to end the country's nearly 50-year armed conflict, President Juan Manuel Santos said Monday. Speaking on national TV, the president said military operations would continue alongside any negotiations with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, commonly known as the FARC. The FARC, which has been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s, is Latin America's oldest insurgency. \"We have developed exploratory talks with the FARC to seek an end to the conflict,\" said Santos, whose popularity has suffered because of the widespread perception that security has worsened under his leadership. He vowed to avoid the mistakes of the past. \"Colombians can rest assured that the government is acting with prudence, seriousness and firmness -- always putting first the welfare and peace of all residents,\" the president said. Santos invited members of a second rebel group -- the National Liberation Army, or ELN -- to also join in the talks. Earlier, current and former government sources told CNN that the government and rebels met in Cuba to discuss the possibility of peace. Present at the discussions, the sources said, were members of the FARC and representatives of Santos. The sources asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to discuss the matter with media. Previously on CNN.com: Indigenous groups clash with Colombian soldiers . The Venezuelan government was reportedly key to bringing the two sides together, the sources said. Peace talks between the rebels and the government have occurred sporadically since the 1980s. The last attempt fell apart in 2002. Then-President Andres Pastrana ended negotiations after rebels launched a series of attacks across the country, in an apparent bid to strengthen their position. Since then, the sides have reached a kind of \"hurting stalemate,\" said Adam Isacson, senior associate at the Washington Office on Latin America. Though severely weakened in recent years, the FARC continues to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces. \"Neither side thinks they're going to win anytime soon,\" said Isacson. \"What they're looking at is losing thousands more people, with nothing to show for it.\" Of course, it remains unclear whether the two sides will reach an agreement at all, and if they do, what that deal might look like. It's also unclear how much of the FARC the group's leadership would be able to deliver, said Isacson. The FARC opened the door for talks this year. In a January statement, rebels said they would be interested in addressing certain issues at a \"hypothetical negotiating table,\" calling on the government to address such subjects as privatization, deregulation and environmental degradation. The statement was signed by the FARC's leader, known as Timoleon Jimenez. \"This conflict will have no solution until our voices are heard. Without lies, Santos, without lies,\" the statement read. This spring, the FARC freed the last of 10 government hostages after holding them for more than a decade. In February, the rebel group said it would also stop kidnapping civilians for money. It did not address the fate of its civilian captives, nor did the group renounce kidnapping for political purposes. Hundreds of civilians remain prisoners of the guerrilla group throughout Colombia, according to the nonprofit Free Country Foundation.

The United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva said delegates agreed Thursday to set up a commission of inquiry to examine what it called \"grave, widespread and systematic\" violations of human rights in North Korea. The decision followed a recent report submitted to the council by an independent expert alleging North Korea had committed a range of abuses, including torture, enslavement, enforced disappearances and murder. Many of the alleged acts \"may amount to crimes against humanity,\" according to the report's author, Marzuki Darusman, an Indonesian lawyer. The council's decision to take action on his report comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula following the North's latest underground nuclear test last month that prompted tougher U.N. sanctions on the regime of Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang has ramped up its rhetoric, issuing threats to Washington and Seoul on a near daily basis. Annual joint military exercises by U.S. and South Korean forces this month have fueled the North's ire. Unsurprisingly, the North Korean representative at the U.N. Human Rights Council, So Se Pyong, had strong words Thursday about the move to establish the commission of inquiry. North Korean video shows imagined attack on Washington . The draft resolution on the matter, adopted by the council without a vote, \"is no more than an instrument that serves the political purposes of the hostile forces in their attempt to discredit the image of the DPRK,\" So said, using the shortened form of North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He warned of \"serious consequences\" if the council went ahead with the inquiry. North Korean citizens are \"happy with pride and honor that they have one of the best systems for promotion and protection of human rights in the world,\" So told the council, according to the U.N. Reports of suffering . His assertions run counter to the accounts of many North Koreans who have fled the country telling of horrific conditions. Humanitarian workers and others who have visited the reclusive state have also described a suffering population. Officials from other countries at the U.N. council disagreed with the North's version of reality. \"For too long, the population of the country has been subjected to widespread and systematic human rights violations and abuses,\" said Gerard Corr, the Irish representative speaking on behalf of the European Union. Human rights groups estimate that as many as 200,000 people are being held in a network of prison camps in North Korea that the regime is believed to use to crush political dissent. In his report to the U.N. council, Darusman identified nine patterns of rights violations in North Korea, such as depriving people of food, arbitrary detentions and heavy restrictions on freedom of expression. Under the issue of enforced disappearances, he also included the abductions of foreign citizens. A leading human rights group called the decision to set up the commission \"a landmark step.\" \"This long awaited inquiry will help expose decades of abuse by the North Korean government,\" said Julie de Rivero, advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. \"The establishment of this commission sends a strong message to Pyongyang that the world is watching and its abuses must end,\" she said.

The Duck Lake Fire has burned more than 22,000 acres and is still going despite recent rains, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources reported on its website. The state agency estimated Monday the blaze is about 51% contained, thanks to progress made by firefighters in maintaining a firm perimeter. Crews have about 40 miles of firelines set up to control the situation, including 6 miles along the shore of Lake Superior. But a lack of roads in the area has complicated efforts. The fire's south end is about 14 miles north of Newberry and 7 miles west of the Yahquamenon Falls State Park campgrounds. Lightning sparked the wildfire late Wednesday afternoon, leaving firefighters little time to contain it before dark. The flames picked up significantly the next day, fanned by strong winds and high temperatures. Since then, the wildfire has taken its toll. While noting that the entire affected area has not been surveyed, the state department said at least 97 structures on 39 different properties have been \"lost\" due to the blaze. Dry conditions have exacerbated the fire danger throughout the region. On Friday, Gov. Rick Snyder banned outdoor burning in 49 counties in northern Michigan in hopes of preventing wildfires.\n(CNN) -- One of the UK's most critically endangered butterflies is making a comeback thanks to a profit making partnership between private landowners and conservation organizations. The heath fritillary -- a rare species exclusive to the south of England that thrives in cleared woodland environments -- has declined sharply over the past 25 years as forest clearing has become less common. But population numbers are on the rise again after the introduction of a forestry management scheme that enables rural landowners to cash in by creating butterfly habitats on their property. \"We were down to 12 colonies (of heath fritillary) in 1995 and most of those were very small,\" says Dr. Martin Warren, chief executive of Butterfly Conservation, the organization behind the projects implementation. \"Since then we've been able to work with landowners to get the management back up again and we are now looking at 25 colonies in the same area.\" See also: Butterfly farmers help protect threatened forests . The conservation scheme works by first sourcing locations where there are remnants of heath fritillary colonies. Those who own the land identified during this process -- be they individuals, businesses or wildlife trusts -- are then approached for permission to carry out the conservation work. This primarily consists of clearing the areas pinpointed of their indigenous plant life and repopulating them with the lighter foliage the heath fritillary requires to prosper. If landowners agree to take part in the project, they are then able to sell on the discarded lumber that accumulates during the clearing and ensuing maintenance process at a profit. See also: Brazil tries to balance farming and forests . \"A lot of this is about persuasion,\" says Warren. \"You have to deal with loads of different people who all have their own agenda and financial constraints.\" \"When you go in there and say 'there is a rare butterfly on your land' you can sometimes get a very bad response,\" he adds. Although Warren admits the profit margins remain relatively small at this stage and that the scheme itself relies on grants from the Forestry Commission to break even, he sees potential for much larger projects in the future. He says that there are currently numerous sites throughout the UK -- where nearly three quarters of butterfly species have seen their numbers decline in the last 10 years -- being scouted for their suitability by Butterfly Conservation. There are also scores of endangered butterfly species across Europe that could benefit from the implementation of similar cleared woodland schemes, he adds. See also: Can wooden skyscrapers transform concrete jungle? \"There are a whole suite of them (countries) where woodlands are not being managed to the detriment of butterflies,\" says Warren. Yet despite his enthusiasm for the project, Warren cautions that there must be a balance struck between maintaining natural forest environments and manipulating their makeup through woodland clearing. \"We wouldn't advocate every woodland area be managed as there are many other species that depend on mature woodland to thrive,\" he says. If an equilibrium between profit, species conservation and respecting natural forest ecosystems can be achieved however, all kinds of diverse forest wildlife could benefit, he adds.\nNew York (CNN) -- After his state's coastline took the brunt of Superstorm Sandy, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Friday that he expects power to be almost fully restored statewide by Saturday night. \"Life will be back -- for most of New Jersey -- to normal come Sunday,\" he told reporters. More than 175,000 households in the Garden State are still in the dark, and homes with saltwater electrical damage will have to be inspected by electricians before having their power restored. \"Some of those homes have already been disconnected,\" said Chris Eck, a spokesman Jersey Central Power & Light, the state's second largest power provider. \"We can't energize the circuit until we know the system is safe.\" Christie's comments came after a tour of the Jersey shore, where Superstorm Sandy ravaged homes and business. \"Much of the iconic boardwalk is buckled and much of the piers are out to sea,\" he said. \"The shore and boardwalk in Seaside Heights of my childhood no longer exists.\" \"This is our Katrina,\" the governor added. Still in the dark, frustration mounts in New York neighborhood . To the north, some 20,000 households across New York City and Westchester County remained without power. Another 150,000 homes in Long Island and harder-hit areas of Queens, such as Rockaway Peninsula, were also in the dark after the double blow of Sandy and this week's nor'easter. But in an attempt to deal with persistently long gas lines, New York police started enforcing a new alternating fuel ration system on Friday. Drivers with license plates that end with a letter or an odd number could fill up Friday, while those with even numbers or zero can fill up Saturday. \"I think it will make the lines go down,\" Sue Powers of Long Island told CNN affiliate NY1. \"Waiting (in) line here for 8Â½ hours is not fun.\" Meanwhile, residents in Long Island who have been without power for 11 days expressed anger at elected officials at a rally Friday, and the politicians deftly redirected the anger at the Long Island Power Authority, charged with restoring power. Local and federal officials who stood to speak before residents in Oceanside, on Long Island, were met with boos and pointed questions about whether they had any power and how comfortable they were. \"What are you doing for us?\" some in the crowd shouted. Braving the boos, Kate Murray, presiding supervisor for the town of Hempstead, suggested residents ask themselves where the utility officials are. \"LIPA is the only entity that can turn on your electricity. Where are they?\" she said. \"They won't talk to us. We call them every day; they won't give us one answer.\" Murray seemed to successfully shift the residents' cries against the politicians into chants of \"Where is LIPA? Where is LIPA?\" \"LIPA has absolutely abrogated all of its duties,\" she said. \"They should be wiped off the face of the earth.\" No one from the utility was present to address the anger. In a written statement, the company said it has more than 8,200 linemen and tree-trimming crews making progress. \"When possible, we will restore power to customers who have been without power for the longest time,\" the utility said in the statement. \"Your safety and well-being remain our No. 1 priority and we thank you for your continued patience during this difficult time.\" U.S. Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-New York, tried to reassure residents that all their elected officials were working around the clock on their behalf. \"Everybody is suffering. We have to get through this together, and we will get through this together,\" McCarthy said. Meanwhile, the National Park Service announced the Statue of Liberty, which had been dark since Superstorm Sandy, was to be relit Friday. The National Park Foundation said the statue \"will once again shine as a beacon of hope, a bright testament to the strength and resilience of the United States and the steadfast ability of our citizens to join together and rebuild in the face of adversity.\" New Jersey, where Sandy made landfall October 29, put gas rationing rules into effect last week in 12 counties. Cold brings fresh misery to Sandy victims . Christie told reporters Thursday that the nor'easter, which brought cold and snow to the area, was responsible for 167,000 new outages but praised utility workers who were trying to get the lights and heat back on. Residents got a break from the cold weather on Friday as temperatures rose into the upper 40s and lower 50s in New England, New York and New Jersey after morning temperatures that dipped into the 30s.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":11},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# import mystery challenge\n\ndfj = pd.read_json(\"mystery.json\")\ndfj.rename(columns = {\"embeddings\": \"embedding\"}, inplace = True)","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"0b3209c9f6db4d389f5df77e62fb524c","source_hash":"c3b4c1c3","execution_start":1665293515149,"execution_millis":7,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":193},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# predict category of mystery article\nprint(categories[kmeans.predict(preprocessing.normalize([dfj[\"embedding\"]]))[0]])","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"0b093695bef74084bd820de3ef7c4f18","source_hash":"89d85400","execution_start":1665293532598,"execution_millis":12,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"World News\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":194},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# print articles most similar to mystery article\n\nsimilarities = [cos_similarity(embedding, dfj[\"embedding\"]) for embedding in df[\"embedding\"]]\nprint(df.iloc[similarities.index(max(similarities)), 3])","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"3b6a713ede994ddfb801750a1d2a05e8","source_hash":"875c5e0d","execution_start":1665293644524,"execution_millis":1063,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"(CNN) -- At least 37 people, including 26 civilians and some Syrian soldiers, were killed in a car bombing Sunday at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Hama, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and state media said.

Arab League Secretary-General Nabil Elaraby said Sunday in Cairo that peace talks were scheduled for November 23 in Geneva, Switzerland, but the date is not firm. \"There are many arrangements to be made and many difficulties which must be overcome to make this conference possible,\" he said. The proposed conference between Syrian government officials and opposition leaders, intended to broker an end to the country's civil war, has been delayed several times. Syria's deputy prime minister said Thursday that the \"presumed dates\" had been agreed to during a conference in the Russian Foreign Ministry. U.N. envoy Lakhdar Brahimi said Sunday that he plans to meet with Russian and U.S. officials as well other representatives of the U.N. Security Council to finalize details. He also stressed that no meeting could be held without a \"convincing opposition that represents Syria's opposition population.\" The U.N. humanitarian chief called on Saturday for a cease-fire in Moadamiyeh in the rural Damascus region so aid workers could evacuate thousands of civilians trapped in the conflict. \"The humanitarian community has stressed time and time again that people must not be denied life-saving help and that the fighting has to stop,\" Valerie Amos, under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said in a statement.
